This tutorial shows how to attach a micro controller to a generic smoke detector
and send notifications over WiFi and SMS to your smartphone. The WeMos(esp2866)
micro controller is turned on by a low power circuit. The micro controller turns
itself off to use the lest amount of power. The software is based on Mongoose OS and utilizes IFTTT.
The case is 3D printed and the device is powered from a LiPo battery.

Genuine testing has been done ;) have fun. watching.
